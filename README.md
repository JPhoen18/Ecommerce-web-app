# Ecommerce-web-app
 A finished Ecommerce Web App 

--------------------------------
  This application is essentially my attempt at creating a mock
E-Commerce Web Application with the functionality and features
of E-Commerce sites that exist today.  My goal was to create an app that 
looked great on desktops and smart phones, while still maintaining
a user-friendly UI. 
   I created this app using Angular for the front-end
and Node/Express.js for the back-end.  For the database, I used PostgreSQL
which was a good choice for this particular project.  This is because
most of the data I would need to store (data regarding items available for purchase, items
user has already purchased) would not need too many changes made to its original 
structure.  Additionally, querying for items(past purchases, liked items, saved purchases) 
made by a particular user ended up being much quicker than querying a nested
document via a noSQL database like MongoDB.

   Some of the challenges in this project revolved around implementing logic for the User's cart, 
positioning of various elements relative to eachother, incorporating GSAP animations, and ensuring
the application looked just as good on mobile screens as it does on desktop screens. However, I was up for the challenge because I enjoy front-end development and design.  In the future, I hope to add more GSAP animations to make the app feel more sleek and inviting.  I also hope to perhaps improve the appearance of some icons so that it is even more user-friendly, and maybe even improve the positioning of some of the divs and sections that I created.  Overall, I feel pretty good about
the finished product.
